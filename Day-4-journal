# Roger Davenport - Learning Journal day 4

Today has been a bit challening. Working with a partner is not as easy as I thought it would be. We had a difficult time keeping our roles seperate. (I'm sure that this will improve with time.)

I did find the class time on CSS interresting, I am feeling a bit better about HTML and CSS, even though I am not very creative. I think that I will be able to create something if I have been given a "mockup".

My brian is feeling fried, but thats probably because I'v not been in a classroom setting for a long time.

I am enjoying the lecture style. Brian you ROCK.
