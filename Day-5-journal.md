# Learning Journal Day 5

Today I think I finally realized the power of CSS. Building out the framework the way we did in class made the whole process come together more clearly. Unfortunately I now have to go back and start my "About Me' project from scratch.

I am starting to get the concept of Git. Friday's lab relating to branches has really helped to see the workflow, I'm still a little unclear as to how that flow would look if there were multiply contributers on a project, but I'm sure we will see that in the coming weeks.
